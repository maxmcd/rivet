# Rivet

Rivet is a collection of tools to help build interactive live streaming experiences. Rivet is a work in progress, but the goal is to provide the following:

*   A video broadcast server that accepts a WebRTC stream and broadcasts RTSP
*   An iOS/Android library to provide a WebRTC source
*   An iOS/Android library to play the RTSP stream
*   A message server to handle stream events and sync them to the video when necessary
